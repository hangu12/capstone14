# Capstone14

Conestoga Capstone Project for Group 14

## Getting Started


```
git clone https://your_token@github.com/hangu12/capstone14.git
cd capstone14
```

Probably, you don't have to run npm install. I've already commit all the node_modules. 

for dev, 
```
npm run dev
```

```
cd client 
npm start 
```

it will ask you to use another port 
say yes, then you will be using 3001 port for client. 

go to localhost:3001
